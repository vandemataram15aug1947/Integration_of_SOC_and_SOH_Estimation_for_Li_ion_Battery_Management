## 🔍 **Introduction**

Battery Management Systems (BMS) play a crucial role in modern energy storage applications, ensuring the efficiency, safety, and longevity of batteries. Among various BMS functions, **State of Charge (SOC) and State of Health (SOH)** estimation are key parameters for optimizing battery performance and reliability.

This project focuses on the **Integration of SOC and SOH Estimation Methods for Li-ion Battery Management**, enabling enhanced performance monitoring and predictive maintenance.

### 💪 **State of Charge (SOC)**

The **State of Charge (SOC)** of a battery indicates the available energy compared to a fully charged battery. It is calculated as:

\(SoC(\%) = 100 \times \frac{Q_0 + Q}{Q_{max}}\)

Where:

- **Q₀ (mAh)** = Initial charge of the battery
- **Q (mAh)** = Charge delivered or supplied (negative for discharge, positive for charge)
- **Qₘₐₓ (mAh)** = Maximum charge that can be stored
- **SoC₀ (%)** = Initial SOC of the battery

</p>  

<p align="center"><b>Figure 1:</b> State of Charge (SOC)</p>  

If the battery is new:
\(Q_{max} = C_r, \quad Q_0 = 0.5 Q_{max}\)
Where **Cᵜ** is the rated capacity as given by the manufacturer.

If the battery is fully charged:
\(Q_0 = Q_{max}, \quad SoC_0 = 100\%\)


### 🏥 **State of Health (SOH)**

The **State of Health (SOH)** measures the condition of a battery compared to a new one and considers aging effects. It is defined as:

\(SoH(\%) = 100 \times \frac{Q_{max}}{C_r}\)

Where:

- **Qₘₐₓ (mAh)** = Maximum charge available in the battery
- **Cᵜ** = Rated capacity

<p align="center"><b>Figure 2:</b> State of Health (SOH)</p>  

A battery with lower SOH will discharge more quickly due to degradation, affecting performance and lifespan.

The discharge profile of a secondary battery is affected by its state of health. The lower the SoH, the faster the battery is discharged, as illustrated in **Figure 3** below:

# **Software Implementation**

## **3. Code Implementation**

### **Main Loop for Motor Speed Control using PWM and PID**
Below is the main loop implementation for controlling the motor speed using a PID controller and PWM:

```c
#include "F28x_Project.h"

// PID Controller Variables
float Kp = 1.0, Ki = 0.1, Kd = 0.01;
float setpoint = 1000.0;  // Desired speed in RPM
float error, prev_error = 0, integral = 0, derivative, duty_cycle;

// Function to Read Motor Speed (Example)
float ReadSpeed(void) {
    return 900.0;  // Replace with actual encoder reading
}

// PID Control Algorithm
void UpdatePID(void) {
    float measured_speed = ReadSpeed();
    error = setpoint - measured_speed;
    integral += error;
    derivative = error - prev_error;

    // Compute control signal
    duty_cycle = (Kp * error) + (Ki * integral) + (Kd * derivative);

    // Limit duty cycle between 0 and 1000
    if (duty_cycle > 1000) duty_cycle = 1000;
    if (duty_cycle < 0) duty_cycle = 0;

    // Update PWM duty cycle
    EPwm1Regs.CMPA.bit.CMPA = duty_cycle;

    prev_error = error;  // Store previous error
}
```
