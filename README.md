## 🔍 **Introduction**

Battery Management Systems (BMS) play a crucial role in modern energy storage applications, ensuring the efficiency, safety, and longevity of batteries. Among various BMS functions, **State of Charge (SOC), State of Health (SOH), and Depth of Discharge (DOD)** estimation are key parameters for optimizing battery performance and reliability.

This project focuses on the **integration of SOC and SOH estimation methods for Li-ion battery management**, enabling enhanced performance monitoring and predictive maintenance.

## ⚡ **What are SOC, SOH, and DOD?**

### 💪 **State of Charge (SOC)**

The **State of Charge (SOC)** of a battery indicates the available energy compared to a fully charged battery. It is calculated as:

\(SoC(\%) = 100 \times \frac{Q_0 + Q}{Q_{max}}\)

Where:

- **Q₀ (mAh)** = Initial charge of the battery
- **Q (mAh)** = Charge delivered or supplied (negative for discharge, positive for charge)
- **Qₘₐₓ (mAh)** = Maximum charge that can be stored
- **SoC₀ (%)** = Initial SOC of the battery

If the battery is new:
\(Q_{max} = C_r, \quad Q_0 = 0.5 Q_{max}\)
Where **Cᵜ** is the rated capacity as given by the manufacturer.

If the battery is fully charged:
\(Q_0 = Q_{max}, \quad SoC_0 = 100\%\)


### 🏥 **State of Health (SOH)**

The **State of Health (SOH)** measures the condition of a battery compared to a new one and considers aging effects. It is defined as:

\(SoH(\%) = 100 \times \frac{Q_{max}}{C_r}\)

Where:

- **Qₘₐₓ (mAh)** = Maximum charge available in the battery
- **Cᵜ** = Rated capacity

A battery with lower SOH will discharge more quickly due to degradation, affecting performance and lifespan.
